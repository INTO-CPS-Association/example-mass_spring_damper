# Case Study Showcasing a Stabilization Technique

This case study shows how the sucessive substitution technique can be used to ensure that a co-simulation is stable.

To know more about co-simulation, successive substitution and other stabilization techniques, please have a look at [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00686v1).

## Overview

Two mass-spring-damper systems are coupled as shown next:

## Running the Case Study


## Detailed Analysis



The option is enabled in the co-simulation config:
